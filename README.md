# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! 🌟 This is where I'll be documenting my journey through this year's challenges, solving puzzles one day at a time.

## 🧩 What is Advent of Code?

**Advent of Code** is an annual event that delivers 25 fun and challenging programming puzzles from December 1st to December 25th. It's a great way to improve coding skills, explore algorithms, and get into the holiday spirit. Learn more at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/).

## 🚀 Project Structure

This repository is organized by day and contains solutions to the puzzles. Each folder corresponds to a specific day's challenge:

```
📂 src/
 ┣ 📂 day01/
 ┃ ┣ 📜 main.py
